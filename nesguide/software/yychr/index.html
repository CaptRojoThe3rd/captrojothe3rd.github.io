				YYCHR is a program for editing CHR-ROM data. It is how you will edit graphics for your NES games.
				<br>
				<br>
				When started, YYCHR will look like the following. You can create a new CHR-ROM by clicking the "New" button. Note that it will create a 16KB CHR-ROM - the NES
				only allows 8 KiB of CHR-ROM without any special cartridges.
			</p>

			<p class="general-font">
				If you want to create a smaller or larger CHR-ROM, you can use a hex editor. The NES's 8 KiB window is 0x2000 in size, so the file should go from 0x0000 to 0x1fff.

				<br>
				<br>

				You could use a different program for editing graphics, such as Piskel. YYCHR supports copying and pasting pixel data, and the temporary bitmap section is useful
				for this, since the colors may not always paste correctly. 

				<br>
				<br>
				<br>

				In YYCHR, there are 3 main sections: On the left, you have the window into the CHR data. This shows an entire 128x128 section of CHR data, or one page in the case
				of the NES. You can see a (by default) 4x4 tile selection box, and clicking in this window moves the selection box around. Note that you can change the
				size of the selection box by holding CTRL and scrolling while hovering your mouse over this area.
				<br>
				<br>
				On the top right, you have the zoomed-in version of the selection box. This allows you to edit each pixel of the tiles you have selected. Holding CTRL and scrolling
				selects the tool on the very right of the window. Left click to draw, right click to pick the color of the pixel.
				<br>
				<br>
				On the bottom right, you have the palette selection. The top part allows you to change between multiple 4-color palettes. The bottom part allows you to change what
				colors make up the 4-color palette.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				YYCHR also supports opening NES ROMs. If you have an NES game that you'd like to edit the graphics of, YYCHR will let you do that.
