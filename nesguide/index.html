				This is a guide for the NES that I wrote using information from <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Nesdev_Wiki">the NESdev wiki</a> and my own experience/learning the NES.
				<br>
				Now for the recipe blogger story...
				<br>
				<br>
				I began writing things for the NES when I was messing around with the Mesen emulator. I was playing SMB3 when I opened the debugger tool and started looking through the 
				disassembly. Mesen shows descriptions for instructions, showing what they do. The debugger tool usually pauses the game a scanline before vBlank, so I quickly found the 
				game's spinning routine. I then looked up an SMB3 memory map, and began messing with values and making cheats through the emulator. These were basic, they just forced a
				value in RAM to be a certain thing, but they worked. I was in to playing SMB3 at this point, and so I found YouTube videos talking about the 7-1 ACE exploit. I also found
				the Mesen assembler. Note that this was in Mesen, not Mesen 2, so I could actually run the code I just wrote as if an interrupt jumped to it. I started by testing JSR $8FE3,
				and it worked. I found (through the memory map) the controller inputs for SMB3, so I added code to check if a button was pressed before winning the game, and this worked.
				I edited the code to only win the game when the player presses SELECT and START at the same time. I then thought to try adding my code to the game. At first I was just
				putting the code in RAM at $0110 every time the game starts. I found an empty space in one of the fixed banks in the ROM, and put the code there. I edited the end of the
				game's spinning routine (since that was what appears in the debugger when I pause the game) to include a JSR to my code, and included the code I replaced in my cheat subroutine.
				From there, I worked to add other cheats, and learned how SMB3 handles bank switching, allowing me to put more code in a different bank with unused space. Then, I decided
				I would try writing my own NES game, eventually deciding to write a Connect 4 game.
