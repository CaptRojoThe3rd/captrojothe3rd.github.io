				The PPU has its own registers. The CPU can talk to the PPU through these registers. These registers are memory-mapped, meaning that the CPU can access them
				with simple load and store instructions.
				<br>
				<br>
				The PPU has 8 memory-mapped registers, mapped to $2000-$2007. They are mirrored throughout $2008-$3fff.

				The PPU Control register controls multiple aspects of the PPU. Many flags are mapped to one or two bits:

				The Base Nametable Address has to do with scrolling. The VRAM Address Increment controls how the PPU automatically increments the VRAM address when reading from/writing
				to VRAM (if you're writing tile data, +1 moves to the tile to the right; +32 moves to the tile to the bottom). The sprite and background tile address controls where the PPU
				gets sprite and background data from on the cartridge.
				<br>
				<br>
				The PPU Mask register controls PPU rendering:

				The most important bits are bits 1-4 -- they tell the PPU to actually render things on the screen.
				<br>
				<br>
				The PPU Status register gives some important info about the state of the PPU:

				Bit 7 is the vBlank flag - it is set when the console reaches the end of the frame. Since the PPU already generates an interrupt, its main use is
				to check whether the PPU has finished initializing at console reset.
				<br>
				Bit 6 is the Sprite 0 Hit flag - it is polled by games to wait for a specific point in rendering, determined by the position of the first sprite. It is
				used by games like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda to have a fixed HUD above a scrolling level.
				<br>
				Bit 5 is the sprite overflow bit. It was intended to tell the game that too many sprites tried to render on one scanline (8 sprite limit). However, it is
				bugged and can generate both false negatives and false positives. You can use it if you are careful, but only in specific circumstances.
				<br>
				<br>
				The rest of the PPU's registers are fairly simple. OAMADDR and OAMDATA are meant to be used for writing sprites, but they aren't really necessary and are
				actually unreliable on some consoles. Just set OAMADDR to zero and don't touch it.
				<br>
				PPUSCROLL is for scrolling the background layer. It takes two writes: first, the byte for X position; and second, the byte for Y position.
				<br>
				PPUADDR and PPUDATA are used for writing to VRAM. The address takes two writes: high byte first, then low. The PPUDATA register can then be used to write
				to VRAM, and will automatically increment PPUADDR according to PPUCTRL.
