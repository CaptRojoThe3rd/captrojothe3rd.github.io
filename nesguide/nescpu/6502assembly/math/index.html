				Math is kind of important in NES games, and in computing in general. Everything a computer does boils down to math, and the NES is no exception.
				<br>
				<br>
				Let's start with the most basic math: adding and subtracting. This is done with the ADC (Add With Carry) and SBC (Subtract With Carry) instructions:

				<p class="code-font" id="code-0"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				If you only need to add/subtract 1, you can use an Increment or Decrement instruction:

				In this example, memory address $01 is added to or subtracted from memory address $00, and the result is stored at memory address $02. But what are these SEC and CLC
				instructions? Well, they are the Clear Carry Flag and Set Carry Flag instructions. But what is the Carry flag?
				<br>
				<br>
				The NES's CPU is 8-bit. This means that the registers can only store values between 0 and 255 or -128 and 127. This isn't a very big range of numbers, and so programmers
				will often run into the issue of 16-bit math on the NES's CPU. This is where the Carry flag comes in.
				<br>
				<br>
				When you add two numbers together on paper, you've probably had to carry a 1 to the next digit. This should give you a clue as to what the Carry flag does. In order
				to make 16-bit math easier, the Carry flag is set when the result of an addition is too big to fit in 8 bits. Then, when the next ADC instruction is executed, the Carry
				flag is added to the result, like how you carry a 1 to the next digit. This makes 16-bit addition much easier:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-1"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				The code above adds the number at $02-$03 to the number at $00-$01, and then stores the result in $04-$05. The Carry flag is cleared for the first addition, since we
				don't want to accidently carry in a 1. However, we don't change the carry flag before the second addition, since we do want to carry in a 1 if necessary. But what
				about subtraction?
				<br>
				<br>
				Well, subtraction with the Carry flag is also pretty simple. For subtraction, it makes more sense to refer to the Carry flag as the "Borrow" flag, and this should also
				give you a clue as to how the flag is used here.
				<br>
				<br>
				When an SBC instruction runs, it performs a subtraction. If that subtraction were to underflow (for example, if the lower 8 bits were to result in the operation 7 - 9),
				then the Carry flag is cleared. Otherwise, it is set. When the next SBC instruction runs, if the Carry flag is clear, then the SBC instruction will subtract 1 from the
				result, making 16-bit subtraction also very simple:

			<br>

				There isn't actually a limit on how many times you can use the Carry flag. You can do math that is 32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit, or anything in between - just don't
				reset the Carry flag before the next ADC instruction.
				<br>
				<br>
				But what about multiplication and division? Those are also very useful operations. Unfortunately, the NES's CPU doesn't have any dedicated multiply and divide 
				instructions. However, there are a few workarounds.
				<br>
				<br>
				First of all, if you are multiplying or dividing by a power of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16...), you can just use bit shifts. To multiply, you would bit shift left using the ASL
				(Arithmetic Shift Left) instruction, and to divide, you would bit shift right using the LSR (Logical Shift Right) instruction:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-3"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				But what if you aren't multiplying or dividing by a power of 2? Well, if the multiplier, then you can combine bit shifts with addition or
				subtraction. Dividing is a little more difficult.
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-4"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				If your multiplier isn't constant or your divisor isn't a power of 2, you can use a dedicated subroutine for multiplication or division:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-5"></p>
			</div>
			<br>
			
			<p class="general-font">
				These subroutines can be called with the JSR (Jump To Subroutine) instruction:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-6"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				You may have noticed ROR and ROL instructions in the multiplication and division routines. Those are Rotate Right and Rotate Left instructions. They function
				similarly to the ASL and LSR instructions, except that they shift in the Carry flag:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-7"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				These instructions allow for shifting 16-bit (or bigger) numbers:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-8"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				Finally, we need to talk about negative numbers. How do they work?
				<br>
				<br>
				Negative numbers are stored in what is called "2's complement". In this system, numbers $00-$7f are normal, in that they still represent numbers 0-127. However,
				$80-$ff are not "normal." They represent numbers -128 to -1. That means $ff = -1, $fe = -2, and so on. This system is actually very good, since it means the ADC and
				SBC instructions can handle negative numbers without any changes.
				<br>
				<br>
				But what about bit shifts? Well, you may have noticed that the shift-left instruction is known as <u>Arithmetic</u> Shift Left, while the shift-right instruction is
				known as <u>Logical</u> Shift Right. Why the difference?
				<br>
				<br>
				The ASL instruction has "Arithmetic" in its name because it is basically compatible with negative numbers. The bit that would indicate a negative number is shifted into
				the carry flag, meaning the code to make sure the number keeps its sign is very simple:
			</p>

			<br>
			<div class="code-object">
				<p class="code-font" id="code-9"></p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<p class="general-font">
				The LSR instruction, on the other hand, doesn't work with signed numbers. However, here is a simple workaround:
