				The 6502/2A03 has a handful of registers inside of it: the Accumulator (A), two Index Registers (X and Y), a Stack Pointer (S, aka SP), the Processor Status (P), 
				and the Program Counter (PC). 
				<br>
				<br>
				A, X, and Y can be loaded with whatever you want and stored wherever you want. The Stack Pointer, S, can be loaded and stored by transfering its data between 
				the X register using the TXS and TSX instructions, but the Stack Pointer serves its own purpose with the stack, so these instructions are rare (many programs never 
				even use TSX).
				<br>
				<br>
				The Processor Status, P, contains flags for the processor. Some are only set by the programmer, such as the Interrupt Disable (I) flag or the Decimal Mode (D) flag.
				Others are set by any instruction affecting a register, such as the Zero (Z) flag or the Negative (N) flag. Others still are only set by arithmetic/logic instructions,
				such as addition or bit shifts. These are the Overflow (V) and Carry (C) flags.
				<br>
				<br>
				The Program Counter, PC, stores the memory address of what instruction the CPU is currently executing. It isn't really "loaded". It is changed when an instruction is
				completed, and some instructions (Branch and Jump instructions) can change it to different areas of the program. It is "stored" when it is pushed onto the stack when
				a JSR (Jump To Subroutine) or BRK (Break) instruction is executed. It is also "loaded" when an RTS (Return From Subroutine) or RTI (Return From Interrupt) pulls it 
				from the stack.
				<br>
				<br>
				All of the CPU registers can be viewed in the Status section of the Debugger:

				Now, three or four 8-bit registers isn't enough memory to accomplish much. That's where RAM comes in. The NES has 2 KiB of RAM mapped to addresses $0000-$07ff
				(and is mirrored at $0800-$1fff). You can use this RAM using load and store instructions, as well as instructions that only affect values in RAM:

				There are also some instructions to transfer between registers, and push/pull registers onto/from the stack:

				However, the console does have more registers and memory than what I've listed. First, we have the PPU registers. These are at addresses $2000-$2007. These registers
				are how the CPU communicates with the PPU. There are also the APU registers at $4000-$401f, which handle audio, controllers, and the moving of sprite data. The PPU
				registers are mirrored at $2008-$3fff. The APU registers are not mirrored anywhere.

				Some cartridges can also have their own RAM, which can be battery-backed for saving games. This is referred to as PRG-RAM or WRAM. This is usually 8 KiB of RAM at $6000-$7fff:

	However, the console does have more registers and memory than what I've listed. First, we have the PPU registers. These registers are how the CPU communicates with
	the PPU, the Picture Processing Unit. There are 8 of these registers. Two of them control how the PPU renders graphics - PPUCTRL and PPUMASK. They are at memory addresses
	$2000 and $2001. There is also the PPUSTATUS register, which the CPU can read to get some specific information about what is currently happening in the PPU. This register
	is at address $2002.
	<br>
	<br>
	There are also PPU registers for writing to or reading from the PPU's memory. First, there are the OAMADDR and OAMDATA registers at addresses $2003 and $2004. These
	registers aren't actually used much, with a game only needing to write to OAMADDR once and never needing to write to OAMDATA. Moving sprite data is generally handled
	by APU register OAMDMA, at address $4014. Two more registers - PPUADDR and PPUDATA at $2006 and $2007 - are used to read from and write to the PPU's address space,
	which contains CHR-ROM/RAM ($0000-$1fff), VRAM ($2000-$2fff), and Palette RAM ($3f00-$3f1f).
	<br>
	<br>
	Finally, there is the PPUSCROLL register at address $2005. This controls where the top left corner of the screen is.
	<br>
	<br>
	Another thing: PPUSCROLL and PPUADDR are both 16-bit registers, but they only use one memory location. To write to PPUADDR, you first write the upper 8 bits of the address,
	and then you write the lower 8 bits of the address. To write to PPUSCROLL, you first write the X scroll, and then you write the Y scroll.
