				No, you won't get sued by Nintendo for using these instructions. Illegal instructions are instructions that weren't ever intended to be exist in the CPU, but do,
				for one reason or another. Naturally, many of these instructions have bugs or unintuitive behavior. A handful will just crash the CPU.
				<br>
				<br>
				I'll only cover the illegal instructions CA65 supports (which are also the only stable ones), with the exception of STP:

				<b>ALR</b>
				<br>
				ANDs Accumulator with value, then shifts right. Equivalent to an AND instruction followed by an LSR instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>ANC</b>
				<br>
				ANDs Accumulator with value, then copies bit 7 into carry flag. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>AXS</b>
				<br>
				Sets X to X AND Accumulator minus a value. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>DCP</b>
				<br>
				Decrements value at memory address, sets flags as if value has been compared with the Accumulator. Equivalent to DEC instruction followed by a CMP instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>ISC</b>
				<br>
				Increments value at memory address, subtracts value at memory address from Accumulator. Equivalent to INC instruction followed by a SBC instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>LAS</b>
				<br>
				Sets Accumulator, X, and Stack Pointer to Stack Pointer AND value at memory address. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>LAX</b>
				<br>
				Loads Accumulator and X with value at memory address. Equivalent to an LDA instruction followed by a TAX instruction.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>RLA</b>
				<br>
				Rotates value at memory address left, then ANDs Accumulator with value at memory address. Equivalent to a ROL instruction followed by an AND instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>RRA</b>
				<br>
				Rotates value at memory address right, then adds value at memory address with the Accumulator. Equivalent to a ROR instruction followed by an ADC instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>SAX</b>
				<br>
				Stores Accumulator AND X and stores it at memory address. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>SLO</b>
				<br>
				Shifts value at memory address left, then ORs Accumulator with value at memory address. Equivalent to an ASL instruction followed by an ORA instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>SRE</b>
				<br>
				Shifts value at memory address right, then XORs Accumulator with value at memory address. Equivalent to an LSR instruction followed by an EOR instruction. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>STP</b>
				<br>
				Stops execution. This isn't actually supported by CA65, but it is somtimes useful for debugging or other purposes. Since it isn't supported by CA65, you need to 
				write the opcode manually or use a macro.
