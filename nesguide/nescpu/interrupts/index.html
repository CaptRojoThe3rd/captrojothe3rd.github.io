				Interrupts in the processor can signal that certain events have begun. There are two types of interrupts: Interrupt Requests (IRQs), and Non-Maskable Interrupts
				(NMIs). You can see the labels for these interrupts in 'main.s':

				NMIs can only be triggered from a source outside the CPU. In the case of the NES, this source is the PPU. When the PPU finishes drawing a frame, it reaches what is
				called vBlank, or Vertical Blanking. This is very useful, as most graphics in the NES can only be updated during vBlank.
				<br>
				<br>
				NMIs can't be disabled in the CPU, hence the name. They are instead controlled by the PPU in the PPUCTRL register. They can be enabled by setting bit 7 of PPUCTRL to
				1. Using the labels we defined earlier, we can set PPUCTRL to this:

				After doing this, there is still a solid color on the screen, but now when we open Mesen's Event Viewer, we can see that an NMI is occurring at the end of the
				visible frame:

				The NMI event seems to "wiggle" because the CPU and PPU aren't perfectly in sync, and because the CPU is slower than the PPU.
				<br>
				<br>
				There are also IRQs, or Interrupt Requests. These can be disabled or enabled by the CPU with the SEI and CLI instructions. Reset code usually begins with
				SEI to disable interrupts. Note that on the stock NES, there aren't any useful IRQs from an external source. However, the BRK (Break) instruction allows for
				software-generated IRQs:

				Note that BRK has a signature byte after it. CA65 only generates one byte for the BRK instruction, so you should put a NOP instruction or some other byte after it.
