				So far, you've just been copying all of the code I've written. Now, I'm going to tell you how you write your own code for the NES.
				<br>
				<br>
				The NES's CPU, the 2A03 (or 2A07 in Europe), is based on the MOS 6502. In fact, Ricoh, the maker of the 2A03, used a legal loophole to avoid paying fees to MOS when 
				making the 2A03. Unfortunately, this involved removing the 6502's Binary Coded Decimal system, which is a shame, as it would have been useful for things like 
				points/player scores.

				In Mesen, you can see everything about the CPU in the Debugger. The disassembly (in red) shows you a disassembled version of the game's code, and shows you what
				instructions the CPU is currently executing. The status (in yellow) shows you the state of the CPU, displaying the contents of registers and processor flags.
			</p>

				Mesen shows a description of each instruction when you hover over it. Combined with the processor status and the stepping functions (above the disassembly), this
				could be a decent way of learning 6502 Assembly. I mean, it's how I learned it. Just set a breakpoint (right click) on an instruction you're confused by, step over it,
				and see how the processor status changes.
				<br>
				<br>
				Another useful debugging tool is the Memory Viewer, which shows the entire memory of the console.

				You can change which memory space you are viewing - the default is CPU's memory space, but this can be changed to the PPU's memory space, or one of the various
				bits of memory in the console.
